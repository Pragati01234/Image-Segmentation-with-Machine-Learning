# Image-Segmentation-with-Machine-Learning
Image segmentation is the process of individually identifying and labeling every pixel in an image, where each pixel having the same label shares certain characteristics. It can detect an object at a granular level and it can identify the shape of that object also. It is an advanced and more accurate way of detecting an object’s edge and shape detection.
Image segmentation divides an image into different partitions known as segments. This collection of segments are represented by a mask or a labeled image. In this way, we can process only the important segments instead of the entire image.
Image segmentation is being used in many different fields. One of the great examples is the medical field. Image segmentation can be used to determine damaged cells in a medical image. Sometimes we not only need the object’s position but we need the shape of that particular object to further process. Cancer can be cured if we can identify cancer cells at an early stage. So by using image segmentation we can identify cancer cells as quickly as possible and save many lives.
Application of image segmentation:
Medical imaging.
Machine vision.
Circuit board defect detection.
Traffic control system.
Self-driving car.
Video surveillance.
Types of image segmentation:
Mainly three types of image segmentation are there.

1. Semantic segmentation: Semantic segmentation associates every pixel of an image with its corresponding classes with the same color.

2. Instance segmentation: Instant segmentation segments each individual object instance in an image and puts a mask with different colors.
